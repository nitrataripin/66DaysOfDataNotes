> LazyEdition: watched a [youtube video from Ken Jee](https://youtu.be/s1gD35Z4eUc) about how APIs benefit data scientists.
<br>

## Day 23
**Thu, 03 Feb 2022**<br>

<br>

## Day 24
**Fri, 04 Feb 2022**<br>
> read an [article at towardsdatascienc](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-label-classification-of-pokemon-types-with-tensorflow-8217a38038a6) about using multilabel classification to classify Pokemon types. The title itself for me was üòØüòØ. It's quite impressive (at least for me) that the model can predict the types of the newer 3D Pokemon by using 2D Pokemon data although the accuracy was not really good for several Pokemon types.<br>
