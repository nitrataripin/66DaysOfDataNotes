## Day 21
**Sun, 30 Jan 2022**<br>
> watched a [youtube video from Ken Jee](https://youtu.be/KEeUR8UDy-s) about the implementation of machine learning in horse racing betting. It's still amazed me how Bill Benter create models to increase his winning probability in betting on horses.
<br>

## Day 22
**Tue, 01 Feb 2022**<br>
> LazyEdition: watched a [youtube video from Ken Jee](https://youtu.be/s1gD35Z4eUc) about how APIs benefit data scientists.
<br>

## Day 23
**Thu, 03 Feb 2022**<br>
> watched a [youtube video from Daliana](https://youtu.be/XJLJMP5SRtU) about tips to get a data science job: *think backward to see what the markets need; have solid understanding of basic knowledge; prioritize skills to learn; learn new things fast; upgrade strategy by getting feedback*
<br>

## Day 24
**Fri, 04 Feb 2022**<br>
> read an [article at towardsdatascienc](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-label-classification-of-pokemon-types-with-tensorflow-8217a38038a6) about using multilabel classification to classify Pokemon types. The title itself for me was ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯. It's quite impressive (at least for me) that the model can predict the types of the newer 3D Pokemon by using 2D Pokemon data although the accuracy was not really good for several Pokemon types.<br>

<br>

## Day 30
**Sun, 13 Feb 2022**<br>
> Worked on some quizzes from coursera: [Data Science Math Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills).
<br>

## Day 31
**Tue, 15 Feb 2022**<br>
> Made notes on course: [Desain & Analisis Sistem](https://teachingfactory.net/program/teknologi-informasi/desain-dan-analisis-sistem/) ([Here](https://nitrataripin.medium.com/catatan-kuliah-desain-analisis-sistem-bagian-1-18ca7d3a67f5) is my notes -- in Bahasa Indonesia). <br>
> I think it'll be an initial step to learn blockchain & NFTs. Then, suddenly a question came up: "*what is the relationship between data science and blockchain?*"<br>
> An [article written by Salih SARIKAYA](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-blockchain-will-disrupt-data-science-5-blockchain-use-cases-in-big-data-e2e254e3e0ab) was the first answer to my question.
